Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * Cover the fundamental principles of computer programming, with an emphasis on problem solving strategies
    using structured programming techniques.
  * Land a strong foundation forming the syntactical basis for object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, and Java.
  * Learn problem analysis, algorithm design, and program implementation.
  * Work in a cross-platform environment
  * Design functions using selection and iteration constructs to solve a programming task
  * Connect functions using pass-by-value and pass-by-address semantics to assemble a complete program
  * Design collections using arrays and structures to manage data efficiently
  * Code algorithms using standard library functions to incorporate existing technology
  * Stream data using standard library functions to interact with users and access persistent text
  * Trace the execution of a procedural program to validate its correctness 
  * Code complete programs using appropriate object and pointer types to solve programming problems
  * Explain the purposes of procedural programming features to inform business persons
  * Prepare programming plans using logical components to solve practical problems
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.
  * Gained a handsome knowledge on all of the topics of Intro to C Programming namely-
