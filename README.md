Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * Design functions using selection and iteration constructs to solve a programming task
  * Connect functions using pass-by-value and pass-by-address semantics to assemble a complete program
  * Design collections using arrays and structures to manage data efficiently
  * Code algorithms using standard library functions to incorporate existing technology
  * Stream data using standard library functions to interact with users and access persistent text
  * Trace the execution of a procedural program to validate its correctness 
  * Code complete programs using appropriate object and pointer types to solve programming problems
  * Explain the purposes of procedural programming features to inform business persons
  * Prepare programming plans using logical components to solve practical problems
  * Gained a handsome knowledge on all of the topics of Intro to C Programming namely-

I declare that all the code & programs in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of C Programming & Intro to Programming Concepts and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
